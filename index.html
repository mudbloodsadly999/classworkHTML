    <h1>Arthur Schopenhauer</h1>
    <h2>"Schopenhauer" redirects here. For other uses, see Schopenhauer (disambiguation).</h2>
    <h3>Arthur Schopenhauer (/ˈʃoʊpənhaʊər/ SHOH-pən-how-ər,[8] German: [ˈaʁtʊʁ ˈʃoːpn̩haʊɐ] ⓘ; 22 February 1788 – 21 September 1860) was a German philosopher. He is best known for his 1818 work The World as Will and Representation (expanded in 1844), which characterizes the phenomenal world as the manifestation of a blind and irrational noumenal will.[9][10][11] Building on the transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), Schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that rejected the contemporaneous ideas of German idealism.[6][7] He was among the first thinkers in Western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of Indian philosophy, such as asceticism, denial of the self, and the notion of the world-as-appearance.[12] His work has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism.[13] Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime, Schopenhauer had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science. His writing on aesthetics, morality, and psychology have influenced many thinkers and artists.</h3>

    <h1>Early life</h1>
    <h2>Arthur Schopenhauer was born on 22 February 1788, in Danzig (then part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth; present-day Gdańsk, Poland) on Heiligegeistgasse (present day Św. Ducha 47), the son of Johanna Schopenhauer (née Trosiener; 1766–1838) and Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer (1747–1805),[14] both descendants of wealthy German patrician families. While they came from a Protestant background, neither of them was very religious;[15]: 79 [16] both supported the French Revolution,[15]: 13  were republicans, cosmopolitans and Anglophiles.[15]: 9  When Danzig became part of Prussia in 1793, Heinrich moved to Hamburg—a free city with a republican constitution. His firm continued trading in Danzig where most of their extended families remained. Adele, Arthur's only sibling, was born on 12 July 1797.

        In 1797, Arthur was sent to Le Havre to live with the family of his father's business associate, Grégoire de Blésimaire. He seemed to enjoy his two-year stay there, learning to speak French and fostering a life-long friendship with Jean Anthime Grégoire de Blésimaire.[15]: 18  As early as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute.[15]: 30 
        
        In 1803, he accompanied his parents on a European tour of Holland, Britain, France, Switzerland, Austria and Prussia. Viewed as primarily a pleasure tour, Heinrich used the opportunity to visit some of his business associates abroad.</h2>

        <h3>Arthur spent two years as a merchant in honor of his dead father. During this time, he had doubts about being able to start a new life as a scholar.[15]: 120  Most of his prior education was as a practical merchant and he had trouble learning Latin; a prerequisite for an academic career.[15]: 117 

            His mother moved away, with her daughter Adele, to Weimar—then the centre of German literature—to enjoy social life among writers and artists. Arthur and his mother did not part on good terms. In one letter, she wrote: "You are unbearable and burdensome, and very hard to live with; all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit, and made useless to the world simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people."[18] His mother, Johanna, was generally described as vivacious and sociable.[15]: 9  She died 24 years later. Some of Arthur's negative opinions about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother.[19]</h3>
