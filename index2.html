    <h1>Friedrich Nietzsche</h1>
    <p>
        Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (/ˈniːtʃə, ˈniːtʃi/ NEE-chə, NEE-chee,[10]
        German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈniːtʃə] ⓘ or [ˈniːtsʃə];[11][12] 15 October
        1844 – 25 August 1900) was a German philosopher. He began his career as a
        classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest
        person to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel
        in 1869 at the age of 24, but resigned in 1879 due to health problems that
        plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the
        following decade. In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward
        a complete loss of his mental faculties, with paralysis and probably
        vascular dementia. He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother
        until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth
        Förster-Nietzsche. Nietzsche died in 1900, after experiencing pneumonia
        and multiple strokes. Nietzsche's work spans philosophical polemics,
        poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for
        aphorism and irony. Prominent elements of his philosophy include his
        radical critique of truth in favour of perspectivism; a genealogical
        critique of religion and Christian morality and a related theory of
        master–slave morality; the aesthetic affirmation of life in response to
        both the "death of God" and the profound crisis of nihilism; the notion of
        Apollonian and Dionysian forces; and a characterisation of the human
        subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as
        the will to power. He also developed influential concepts such as the
        Übermensch and his doctrine of eternal return. In his later work, he
        became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual
        to overcome cultural and moral mores in pursuit of new values and
        aesthetic health. His body of work touched a wide range of topics,
        including art, philology, history, music, religion, tragedy, culture, and
        science, and drew inspiration from Greek tragedy as well as figures such
        as Zoroaster, Arthur Schopenhauer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Richard Wagner,
        and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

        After his death, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth became the curator and
        editor of his manuscripts. She edited his unpublished writings to fit her
        German ultranationalist ideology, often contradicting or obfuscating
        Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism
        and nationalism. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became
        associated with fascism and Nazism. 20th-century scholars such as Walter
        Kaufmann, R. J. Hollingdale, and Georges Bataille defended Nietzsche
        against this interpretation, and corrected editions of his writings were
        soon made available. Nietzsche's thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the
        1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th- and early
        21st-century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of
        continental philosophy such as existentialism, postmodernism, and
        post-structuralism—as well as art, literature, poetry, politics, and
        popular culture.

        Born on 15 October 1844, Nietzsche[13] grew up in the town of Röcken (now
        part of Lützen), near Leipzig, in the Prussian Province of Saxony. He was
        named after King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, who turned 49 on the day
        of Nietzsche's birth (Nietzsche later dropped his middle name
        Wilhelm).[14] Nietzsche's parents, Carl Ludwig Nietzsche (1813–1849), a
        Lutheran pastor[15] and former teacher; and Franziska Nietzsche (née
        Oehler) (1826–1897), married in 1843, the year before their son's birth.
        They had two other children: a daughter, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, born
        in 1846; and a second son, Ludwig Joseph, born in 1848. Nietzsche's father
        died from a brain ailment in 1849; Ludwig Joseph died six months later at
        age two.[16] The family then moved to Naumburg, where they lived with
        Nietzsche's maternal grandmother and his father's two unmarried sisters.
        After the death of Nietzsche's grandmother in 1856, the family moved into
        their own house, now Nietzsche-Haus, a museum and Nietzsche study centre.

<h3>Nietzsche was an amateur composer.[21] He composed several works for voice, piano, and violin beginning in 1858 at the Schulpforta in Naumburg when he started to work on musical compositions. Richard Wagner was dismissive of Nietzsche's music, allegedly mocking a birthday gift of a piano composition sent by Nietzsche in 1871 to his wife Cosima. German conductor and pianist Hans von Bülow also described another of Nietzsche's pieces as "the most undelightful and the most anti-musical draft on musical paper that I have faced in a long time"</h3>
